It is duty of few to lead others to greatness.
Leaders come from many places and might have many different titles.
Some leaders might not even be official leaders.
But one with this secret is \textit{de facto} leader of specified group.
Groups typically have cause and your duty is to work toward that.
People from that group will do what you command them.
They do it because they know their duty and your duty.
You are typically still seen as servant for the cause of the group and, in the end expendable.
