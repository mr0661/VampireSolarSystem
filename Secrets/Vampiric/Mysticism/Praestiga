Ability to create illusions.
All illusions need to make sense to everyone.
If it seems totally impossible or something that person does not have context of illusion fails and is seen through.
If illusion brakes, one is still able to see illusion when they want it just does not have effect what they do not want.

You have convinced someone to spend more they can to something worthless.

:1:
Create surface illusion in your presence. Have some simply color and minor details that of another.
You can use \AbilityNameDeceit{} or \AbilityNameExpression{} depending on situation to determine how realistic something is.

:2:
Create illusionary object. They seem so real that they can even cause minor damage to people as long as they believe those object exist.
They can contain information that either you or one viewing illusion has. 
You could, for example, summon book that has name of each person that one viewing it knows. When you look at that book there is only few names, when other looks at it, it contains everything he can remember.

:3:
Illusions you create are permament or last exactly as long as you want. You even create illusionary people but these do not exists outside your presence.
