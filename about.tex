\ThisBook{} provides stand alone rules for playing tale and drama with vampires.
Protagonists might be vampires or some folk mingled with vampires somehow.
\ThisBook{} contains what you need to play game with vampires in it, where story is in focus.

\ThisBook{} uses Solar System for base of its rules.
Solar System (Eero Tuovinen 2008) is based on The Shadow of Yesterday (Clinton R. Nixon 2005).
However, inspiration to \thisBook{} is The World of Near (Eero Tuovinen 2009) which can be described as Solar System meeting The Shadow of Yesterday.
Solar System is rule set without setting, and purpose of \thisBook{}, is to provide vampire setting for these rules.
\ThisBook{} is designed so, that Solar System is not required reading, \thisBook{} contains all rules needed of play. % TODO change "this book"
Solar System is not retold here though, plan is to provide good solid rule set so people can play great, dramatic game with vampires.

% TODO Add blood pun here to say "Have good game"
