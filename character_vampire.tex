Vampire player characters are discussed in this chapter.

Vampiric curses

As vampire legends go, there are several.
It is up to each group to choose what kind creatures vampires are.
It is commonly known, that vampires have told several legends about themselves.
Some have done this to frighten, hurt other vampires, out of self loathing, or to misdirect.
These are represented with vampiric curses.

There are two ways of acquiring vampiric curses.
All vampires gain some set of curses when they shed mortality and become vampires.
This is not players choice, as it is more of what world does to them.
Other way is to lose \humanity{}, as each \humanity is paired with some curse.
That curse becomes part of vampires existance, if they fail to follow that ideal.
This is how vampires become more mosterous as time progresses, and struggle for them to keep their humanity.
List of vampiric curses can be found from \ref{ssec:curses}.

When creating vampire character, in addition to normal process, choose at least one key to represent your vampiric nature.
In addition, you need to choose at least one \humanity/vampiric curse pair.
Vampiric curse is not active as long you keept your \humanity intact.
If you brake against your \humanity, you take Instinct damage depending on bad your violation is.
This represent regret vampire feels for their action.
If vampire does not feel regret (players choice), then that \humanity is lost forever.
This can be treated as normal key buyoff.
Vampire should have 1-3 \humanities, getting new ones without spending advantages on them.
There is limit to this, you can have total of 7 different \humanities during \campaign.
Losing last one of these, means that there is nothing human left of the vampire and it has become pure monster.
This can be considered death of the character but player might be allowed to play to end of the current \session, showing what kind of monster vampire has become.
