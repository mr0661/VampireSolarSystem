Sometimes you might need to have secret to even try.
It is not necessary to have several status secrets if all apply, just choose most describing then (Wealthy king would might be Nobility where rich baron might be Wealthy).
However, if these are unrelated to each other, for example character is vampiric nobility and french political leader, it might make sense to have both.

%% KEYS %%

\textbf{Key}

Most important and difficult key is key of humanity. It consist of several steps where you can lose humanity slowly. 
Each vampire has set of principles.
More you have, more easily you can function in society.
Maximum number is 7 and minimum is 1.
If all principles are lost, vampire loses its mind.
As more and more principles are lost vampire becomes more obsessive on the remaining ones.
It is possible to develop other principles but whenever principle is lost it cannot be replaced.


% OTA uusi "vampiric curse"
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{-2pt}
\item[7] normal vampiric curses still apply
\item[6-] it costs single point from any pool to wake up. If you do can't, you slumber
\item[5-] it costs 1 Vigor to appear as a living, to have bodily functions as a living
\item[4-] you acquire some mental illness
\item[3-] you are unable to eat regular food or drink
\item[2-] you cannot consume animal blood
\item[1] you cannot spend Vigor anymore to appear as a human.
\end{itemize}

% kerrallaan saa olla enintään kolme, toimivat kuin avaimet, mutta ilmaisia
Example principles are:
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{-2pt}
\item Kindness towards others
\item Do onto others as you would have them to do to you
\item Justice and fairness
\item Right of everyone to decide their own fate
\item Right for everyone to their own bodies
\item Respect for human life
\item Integrity of your own body
\end{itemize}

You can write your own. These can also be changed between sessions. However, if one is lost it cannot be replaced. It will be marked as broken principle and it is permanent loss.

Key of Humanity is linked with these. As these describe principles, Key of Humanity is how these can be lost.

\KeyHumanity{}

\KeyNameHumanity{} speaks of remorse. If you break a principle you can:
\begin{itemize}
\item[a.] Buyoff principle. Cross over one principle that you broke with an action, take 10 experience. Vampire will always have \KeyNameHumanity{}
\item[b.] Feel remorse. Take Reason damage for each principle you broke. Each broken principle can contribute between 1 - 3 points of damage. If damage would be larger than largest damage track remorse is impossible.
\end{itemize}

If principles are changed it means that the new thing is actually the real principle and has always been, other has been self deception.
If vampire has broken new principle he has to feel remorse from each of those missteps.
Braking principle should be informed decision from players.
It should not be clear accident.
However, it might be something that player did not want to happen.

\textit{For example, new vampire is unable to control his bloodlust. He therfore tries to drink his beloved forcefully. This is does not respect right that everyone has to their own bodies or respect for life. However as this would be unintentional, it is deemed that first contributes 2 point and second only 1. This means that if this happens, it either cause buyoff or remorse worth of 3 points.
Player has no ability to fight against this kind of bloodlust knowing what the stake (in addition of the beloved).}

\pagebreak
\textbf{Vampiric keys}
These are optional keys but usually required. Without any following penalties apply:
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{-2pt}
\item You have natural instinct for blood. Whenever you see blood and do not feed some, take one instinct damage.
\item Existance feels to be without meaning. It costs one from Instinct pool and Reason pool to rise on morning (in addition to any other costs)
\end{itemize}
These are both discourage and to relate what happens if these urges are not directed elsewhere.
These keys shown are just some possible keys.
Important part is that they relate to vampiric existance.

\cols{
\VampiricKey{}

%% POOLS %%
\pagebreak
Pools are normal, expect for refershing condition:

\begin{itemize}
\item[\textbf{Vigor}] Drink human blood directly from vein or drink animal blood and do some physical enjoyment. This can be hard partying, doing drugs, sparring or anything that involves someone else.
\item[\textbf{Instinct}] Hunt for blood in social setting or interact with your kind in social setting.
\item[\textbf{Reason}] Try to understand your existence. Alternatively, drink blood in intellectually stimulating interaction such as poetry recital, a late-night philosophical debate or a chess match.
\end{itemize}
