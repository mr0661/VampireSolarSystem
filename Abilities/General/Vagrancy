This is how beggars and drifters survive.
It is about gathering what you can to survive.
When everything is in dumps, this can be used to keep on living without anything else than clothes on your back.
Used when living within civilized people.
You for example, you trick, beg, loot, or dumpster dive.
You do whatever it takes.
Some of these are illigal but all are benign.
If you try to maintain dignity by not doing something, take penalty die.
If want to do this without braking any laws, take penalty die.
