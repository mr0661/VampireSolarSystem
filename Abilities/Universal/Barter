Bartering is something that every human has done.
This is typically done when trying to buy something.
It is both understanding value of something as it is to have someone to miss understand value.
Though it is commonly used when purchasing goods, skilled barterer could convince bandits that he is more valuable alive than he is dead.
Use this to acquire something.
