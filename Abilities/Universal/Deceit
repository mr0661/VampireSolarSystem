Deceit is art of making people believe you.
It is about creating impression that something is the truth.
This archieved with many tricks, e.g. giving misleading information, lying, or telling the truth.
Deceit does not necessary need to be about giving false information, though it is what most people use it.
Sometimes it can be using weakness of mind against itself and help to person understand the reality.
As the tricks are same, ability is the same.
