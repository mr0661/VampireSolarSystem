Memory is skill that many value.
It is about recalling something.
Used when it is not clear that someone could remember such detail.
However, everything that is stated to happen is assumed to be in such importance, that characters remember them for rest of their lives.
Memory can be used to bring interesting facts into the game.
Player could ask that when new NPC is introduced to remember something about them.
If they succeed, they remember, and such fact should be generated in a spot.
For example, character might remember that same phrase was used by her nemesis and can now suspect that this character knows her nemesis.
