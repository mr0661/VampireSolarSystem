This is used when fighting against opponent that uses ranged weapon.
Ability is opposed when fighting with proper weapons, e.g. ranged weapon or with shield.
Some other tools or situation might also produce opposed roll.
It can also be used while wielding melee weapon but then roll is likely to be parallel and with penalty.
It is also possible to use this simply to avoid an attack.
