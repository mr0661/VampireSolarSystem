Used when fighting in clear duel situation.
This is used mainly to survive in such situations, not necessary to win it.
If winning is only way to survive such event, then winning might be what success indicates.
It requires that fight is clearly organized and follows some sort of rules.
Duels are not typically to the death. 
This roll is typically contested by your opponent but is not always.
